- The system should have **git installed** in it if not install git. Make sure to choose Run git from Windows Command prompt option during installation. Otherwise, open git bash in place of step 2.
- Change the current working directory to your local project.
- Initialize the local directory as a git repository in different ways as described in the image.
> git init

- A **new .git folder** is created in the directory which is by **default hidden**.
- Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
> git add .  return
#Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. To unstage a file, use  
git reset HEAD YOUR_FILE

- Commit the files that youâ€™ve staged in your local repository.
> git commit -m 'First commit'
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository.
  To remove this commit and modify the file, use
git reset --soft HEAD~1
